README for Google Eduroam Logins
********************************

Description
===========

This is a simple project meant to extract logins from radsecproxy-logs in order
to display login-counts from different institutions on a map.

Installation
============

In order to use this you'll need the following:
- ruby installed
- geoip ruby gem installed
- geopiplookup libraries installed system-wide (optional)
- a valid Google Maps API key

Usage
=====

Start by downloaded an up-to-date version of GeoLiteCity.dat (using the
update_db.sh script). Or use the commercial version if you got that ;)

Our simple setup can be inferred from looking at the get_and_combine.sh script.
Of course you'll have to adapt it to your local setup. The institutions.txt
(which is the intermediate file) has to be in the following form:

rwth-aachen.de
fh-aachen.de
...

Which is what line 3 and 4 take care of. Afterwards its sorted, downcased and
counted, so institutions.rb can process it and output countries.js. The whole
html subtree can then be copied to a web-accessible host. Don't forget to adapt
index.html to your needs.

Development
===========

Outstanding bugs and problems are documented in the TODO. Patches to general
problems (i.e. not special to your local setup) are gladly accepted at
gilger@rz.rwth-aachen.de. If possible use git to manage the source and generate
commits as patches (see git format-patch).
