What doesn't work
-----------------
- Some placemarks are undeterministic (kuleuven.be for example)
- Clustering still sucks
- Dynamic zoom (with bounds.extend) doesn't work (JavaScript variable visibility problem I suppose)

Still todo before public release
--------------------------------
- Write documentation
- Make some stuff easy to configure (map-dimensions, templates for the html, logfiles, etc)
- Get-script for geo-ip-database [DONE]
